# ALX School for Software Engineering - Functions and Nested Loops

This repository contains my C tasks for the Functions and Nested Loops module at ALX School for Software Engineering. Throughout this module, I learned and implemented various concepts related to functions, nested loops, coding style, and project requirements.

## Nested Loops

Nested loops are loops within loops. They allow us to perform repetitive tasks multiple times, with each iteration of the outer loop triggering the inner loop to execute a certain number of times. This concept is commonly used when working with multidimensional arrays, matrices, and patterns.

## Functions

A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It allows us to modularize our code, improve code readability, and promote code reusability. Functions can have parameters and return values, providing flexibility and enabling code abstraction.

## Declaration vs Definition

The declaration of a function includes its name, return type, and parameter types (if any), and serves as a way to inform the compiler about the existence of the function. The definition, on the other hand, includes the actual implementation of the function, providing the executable code for the declared function.

## Prototypes

A function prototype is a declaration of a function that provides the necessary information about the function's name, return type, and parameter types. Prototypes are typically placed in header files to allow other files to access and use the functions defined in a particular source file.

## Scope of Variables

The scope of a variable refers to its visibility and accessibility within a program. Variables can have local scope, where they are accessible only within a specific block or function, or global scope, where they are accessible throughout the entire program. Understanding variable scope is crucial for managing data and preventing naming conflicts.

## GCC Flags

GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) is a widely used compiler for the C programming language. The following flags are commonly used:

- `-Wall`: Enables all warning messages.
- `-Werror`: Treats warning messages as errors, causing the compilation to fail if any warnings are generated.
- `-Wextra`: Enables additional warning messages not covered by `-Wall`.
- `-pedantic`: Ensures strict adherence to the standard rules of the C language.
- `-std=gnu89`: Sets the C language standard to GNU C89, allowing the use of specific language features.

## Header Files

Header files contain function prototypes, type definitions, and macro definitions that are shared across multiple source files. They allow for modular programming, providing a central location for commonly used declarations. Header files are included using the `#include` preprocessor directive.

## Project Requirements

Throughout the tasks in this repository, I followed specific project requirements, including but not limited to:

- Using editors such as vi, vim, and emacs.
- Compiling code on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the specified flags.
- Ending all files with a new line.
- Following the Betty coding style, checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
- Avoiding the use of global variables.
- Adhering to the restrictions on standard library functions, except for `_putchar`.
- Including function prototypes and the `_putchar` prototype in the `main.h` header file.
- Pushing the header file to the repository.

## Note:
The provided information is a summary of the key concepts and project requirements covered during the Functions and Nested Loops module. It is recommended to refer to the specific task instructions and ALX School's official documentation for detailed explanations and further guidance.

I am proud of my progress and the knowledge gained during my journey at ALX School for Software Engineering. Through this repository, I have documented my learning and practical implementation of various C programming concepts related to functions, nested loops, coding style, and project requirements.

I look forward to continuing my learning and tackling more challenging tasks in future modules. ALX School has provided me with a solid foundation in C programming, enabling me to enhance my problem-solving skills and become a proficient software engineer.
