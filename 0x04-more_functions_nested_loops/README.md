ALX School - Software Engineering Journey

This repository documents my learning journey and the tasks I have achieved at ALX School for Software Engineering. Here is a summary of my progress and the concepts I have covered today:

## General

- **Nested Loops**: I have learned about nested loops and how they allow us to perform repetitive tasks multiple times, with each iteration of the outer loop triggering the inner loop.
- **Functions**: I have learned about functions, which are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. I now understand how to use functions to modularize my code, improve readability, and promote reusability.
- **Declaration vs Definition**: I have learned the difference between the declaration and definition of a function. The declaration includes the function's name, return type, and parameter types, while the definition provides the actual implementation of the function.
- **Prototype**: I now understand the concept of a function prototype, which declares the function's name, return type, and parameter types. Prototypes are typically placed in header files to allow other files to access and use the functions.
- **Scope of Variables**: I have learned about variable scope, which determines the visibility and accessibility of variables within a program. I now understand the concept of local and global variables and how they affect the lifespan and accessibility of data.
- **GCC Flags**: I have learned about the GCC flags `-Wall`, `-Werror`, `-Wextra`, `-pedantic`, and `-std=gnu89`. These flags enable specific warning messages, treat warnings as errors, and enforce strict adherence to the C language standards.
- **Header Files**: I have learned about header files and how to use them with the `#include` directive. Header files contain function prototypes, type definitions, and macro definitions that are shared across multiple source files, promoting modular programming.

## Requirements

To ensure consistency and adherence to project standards, the following requirements should be followed:

- **Editors**: Use editors such as vi, vim, or emacs for writing code.
- **Compilation**: All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- **New Line**: All files should end with a new line.
- **README.md**: A README.md file is mandatory at the root of the project folder.
- **Betty Style**: Follow the Betty style guidelines. Your code will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- **Global Variables**: Avoid the use of global variables.
- **Function Limit**: Each file should contain no more than 5 functions.
- **Standard Library**: Do not use functions from the standard library, such as printf and puts.
- **_putchar**: You are allowed to use the `_putchar` function.
- **_putchar.c**: Do not push the `_putchar.c` file. It will not be taken into account.
- **main.c**: The provided `main.c` files are examples for testing functions, but you don't need to push them to your repository. The compilation process will use its own `main.c` files.
- **Header File**: Include the prototypes of all your functions and the `_putchar` prototype in your `main.h` header file.
- **Push**: Don't forget to push your header file.
