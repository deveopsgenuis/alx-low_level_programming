## Description

In this repository, you will find my implementations of various C programming tasks and exercises. These tasks cover topics such as pointers to pointers, multidimensional arrays, and common C standard library functions for string manipulation.

The code in this repository adheres to the ALX School coding standards, including the use of the Betty style. It has been tested and compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using the gcc compiler with specific options.

## Requirements

To compile and run the code in this repository, you need:

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- gcc compiler
- Standard C library

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

├── 0-memset.c
├── 1-memcpy.c
├── 2-strchr.c
├── 3-strspn.c
├── 4-strpbrk.c
├── 5-strstr.c
├── 7-print_chessboard.c
├── 8-print_diagsums.c
├── _putchar.c
├── 100-set_string.c
├── 101-crackme_password.c
├── README.md
└── main.h


Each file corresponds to a specific task or exercise, and it contains the implementation and necessary function definitions.

## Usage

You can clone this repository and explore the code. Feel free to modify or extend the code according to your needs.

To compile the code, navigate to the repository's root directory and use the gcc compiler:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 <file_name.c> -o <output_file>

Replace <file_name.c> with the name of the C file you want to compile and <output_file> with the desired name of the compiled executable.

For example, to compile 0-memset.c, you can use the following command:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 0-memset.c -o my_program

./my_program
