C_Programming - Readme

ðŸ“˜ This repository contains my solutions to various programming tasks in C. I have successfully completed these tasks as part of my learning journey at ALX School for Software Engineering.

## Tools Used
- **gcc**: I used the GNU Compiler Collection (gcc) to compile my C code.
- Compiler Options:
  - `-Wall`: Enables all compiler warning messages.
  - `-Werror`: Treats all warnings as errors, ensuring strict adherence to coding standards.
  - `-Wextra`: Enables additional compiler warnings for enhanced code quality.
  - `-pedantic`: Ensures strict conformance to the C language standards.
  - `-std=gnu89`: Sets the C language standard to GNU C89.
- **vi, vim, emacs**: I utilized these text editors to write and edit my C code.

## Learning Objectives
Throughout my tasks, I have covered various concepts and topics in C programming, including:

âœ¨ Understanding the awesomeness of C programming and its versatility.
âœ¨ Learning about the inventors of the C language, namely Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan, and Linus Torvalds.
âœ¨ Exploring the process of compiling C code using `gcc`.
âœ¨ Understanding the entry point of a C program and the significance of the `main` function.
âœ¨ Using different functions like `printf`, `puts`, and `putchar` to print text to the console.
âœ¨ Utilizing the `sizeof` operator to determine the size of specific types.
âœ¨ Compiling C code with the appropriate flags and options.
âœ¨ Adhering to the official C coding style and checking code using `betty-style`.
âœ¨ Identifying the correct headers to include when using standard library functions.
âœ¨ Understanding how the `main` function's return value influences the program's exit status.

By completing these tasks, I have gained a solid foundation in C programming and developed skills in writing clean, well-formatted, and efficient code.

Feel free to explore the repository and review my solutions to deepen your understanding of C programming concepts.
