ALX School - Software Engineering Journey

This repository documents my learning journey and the tasks I have achieved at ALX School for Software Engineering. Here is a summary of my progress and the concepts I have covered today:

## General

- **Pointers**: I have learned about pointers and how to use them. Pointers are variables that store memory addresses, allowing us to manipulate and access data indirectly. I now understand the basics of pointer syntax and how to dereference pointers to retrieve the stored value.
- **Arrays**: I have learned about arrays and how to use them. Arrays are collections of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations. I now understand how to declare, initialize, and access elements in an array.
- **Pointers vs Arrays**: I have learned the differences between pointers and arrays. Although arrays and pointers have similarities, they are not the same. I now understand concepts such as pointer arithmetic and how arrays decay into pointers in certain contexts.
- **Strings**: I have learned how to use strings and manipulate them. Strings in C are arrays of characters terminated by a null character ('\0'). I now understand string manipulation functions and how to perform common operations such as concatenation, copying, and comparing strings.

## Requirements

To ensure consistency and adherence to project standards, the following requirements should be followed:

- **Editors**: Use editors such as vi, vim, or emacs for writing code.
- **Compilation**: All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- **New Line**: All files should end with a new line.
- **README.md**: A README.md file is mandatory at the root of the project folder.
- **Betty Style**: Follow the Betty style guidelines. Your code will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- **Global Variables**: Avoid the use of global variables.
- **Function Limit**: Each file should contain no more than 5 functions.
- **Standard Library**: Do not use functions from the standard library, such as printf and puts.
- **_putchar**: You are allowed to use the `_putchar` function.
- **_putchar.c**: Do not push the `_putchar.c` file. It will not be taken into account.
- **main.c**: The provided `main.c` files are examples for testing functions, but you don't need to push them to your repository. The compilation process will use its own `main.c` files.
- **Header File**: Include the prototypes of all your functions and the `_putchar` prototype in your `main.h` header file.
- **Push**: Don't forget to push your header file.
